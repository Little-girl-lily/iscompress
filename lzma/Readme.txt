Nearly all of the code in this directory and subdirectories is
from the LZMA SDK version 4.49 by Igor Pavlov:

  http://www.7-zip.org/

See lzma.txt for the LZMA SDK's license terms.

The Inno Setup-specific files in the CPP\7zip\Compress\ISLZMA
directory may be used under the same license terms as the
LZMA SDK. In fact, you can do whatever you want with them;
I make no claim of copyright.

The Visual C++ 2005 project file I use to build ISLZMA.dll is
located in the CPP\7zip\Compress\ISLZMA directory.
